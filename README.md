## About

This is our final project for CS 174A Spring 2022 at UCLA. Using tiny-graphics, we implemented
a simple balloon popping game inspired by Bloons (please don't sue us). In addition to the basic
game, we have 2 advanced features:

* Physics based motion (dart)
* Collision detection (popping balloons)

Some notable challenges included refining the dart's parabolic motion, adjusting the angle of the camera
for hard mode, and implementing logic for a game (resetting, hard mode, win/lose conditions, etc.)</br>
