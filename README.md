# bloons

goals for midway demo
    - add colors/textures for balloons, monkey, dart, platform
    - have dart/dart gun attached to monkey, be able to move up and down (kind of like real game when you move the mouse to set the dart trajectory before clicking to shoot) - probably use up and down arrow keys?
    
minimum final goals
    - add cloudy background
    - shooting the dart functionality (space bar maybe?) with parabolic motion
    - collision detection between dart and balloon
    
stretch goals
    - allow limited arrows
    - be able to detect if all the balloons are popped, prompting a "you win" or "try again"
